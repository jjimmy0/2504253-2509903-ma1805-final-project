OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
‘Under the digital spotlight’ draws significant inspiration from the website love.xxx, which takes viewers on a journey through internet culture humour while also exploring the dehumanization of celebrities. The project reflects on the way digital surveillance has transformed our perception of celebrity lives, turning what was once considered private into public spectacles. In this era, paparazzi photos, once seen as invasive or harmful, have been recontextualized as iconic artifacts of modern culture. The aesthetic of the 2010s brutalist style heavily influences the visual design. This style, with its raw, unrefined look, mirrors political brutalism by emphasizing the harshness. It a reminisce of the blog era of the internet. 3x2 interactive image grid that reacts to user interaction, triggering hover effects and transitions between images, along with hidden text and generative animations. 
INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
[Joy Jimmy]:
My role in the project was to build the technical structure of the interactive image grid. Using HTML and CSS Grid, I designed the layout to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. The interactive image transitions, triggered by hover actions, were implemented using JavaScript. I created smooth fade-in and fade-out effects through opacity, which allowed the images to shift without causing jarring visual disruptions. I also contributed to the timed animation system for the second-row subpages, where text fades in and out in a looping sequence. This generative text effect ties into the project's theme of ephemeral content, where meaning constantly shifts and becomes inaccessible. Additionally, my javascript isn’t as strong as my HTML and CSS knowledge so I struggled with having to create an interactive website that was dependent on javascript, initially I wanted the slideshow to run through a hover but I couldn’t get that to work so I decided to make the slideshow automated. I had some issues with making the grid without the images moving around and I co-wrote the README file. 
[Suha]:
I contributed to the long paragraphs include hidden words that appear only when hovered over. I wrote the conceptual copy and developed a CSS to detect specific classes and toggle visibility using opacity. I helped with the thematic vision of the project as well as the visual ideas and selecting the photographs used and co-wrote the README file.

THEMES
Our theme was rooted in the idea of digital transformation and the discovery of hidden meanings. As users interact with the image grid, they reveal and conceal different layers of information, much like how digital spaces have reshaped the way we experience identity. The project critiques the pervasive nature of digital surveillance and its impact on how we perceive public figures. Celebrities, once protected by their personal privacy, are now subjected to constant scrutiny, their lives becoming increasingly publicized and commodified. 
DESIGN
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The 3x2 image grid is constructed using CSS Grid, which provides a clean 2D layout adaptable to all screens. JavaScript is used to control image transitions triggered by hover actions, with a smooth fade effect to enhance the visual experience. The internal pages also employ JavaScript to animate large text elements, which appear and fade in a loop, creating a generative and fluid feel. The interaction design emphasizes hover states and smooth transitions, making the entire experience feel responsive and engaging. A key aspect of the design was ensuring that each component was modular and reusable, allowing for easy expansion in the future.

AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS
Aesthetic decisions were closely tied to the technical capabilities we learned. We used large-scale images with minimal UI to focus user attention on interaction. The fade transitions are slow and smooth, creating a dreamlike feel in keeping with the theme of fragmentation and delay. The colour scheme was neutral to maintain focus on the imagery and text. Typography was carefully selected for readability and impact, especially on pages featuring animated large text. Overall, the aesthetic strategy was to create a clean but mysterious interface that encouraged slow, thoughtful engagement.

UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT
With more time, we would have implemented Despite the project's completion, there are several unrealized aspects that could be explored in future iterations. Adding sound effects triggered by hover or click interactions would further immerse users, reinforcing the themes of digital interaction and sensory overload. Another idea was using p5js to create a page where you could move the image around the screen while it floats around.
